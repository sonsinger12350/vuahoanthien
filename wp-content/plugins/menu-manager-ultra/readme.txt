== Description ==

NEW! Menu Manager for sites with large or deep menus. This is a drag and drop menu manager that allows content managers to add, edit, remove, or re-order their WordPress menus.

Other plugins with similar functionality suffer from usability or crashing problems on large sites - Menu Manager Ultra solves them all!

Powerful tools to edit, update, drag & drop large menus on WordPress sites.

The default WordPress menu editor leaves a lot to be desired. It is also almost unusable once your WordPress website menu reaches into hundreds or even thousands of items. Menu Manager Ultra for WordPress provides an easy, dynamic way to sort, edit, and remove menu items even on large WordPress websites with many menu items.
